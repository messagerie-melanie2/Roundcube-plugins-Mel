Works on Roundcube 1.2.3

You need to add mel_larry_mobile skin (https://github.com/messagerie-melanie2/roundcube_skin_melanie2_larry_mobile) in the Roundcube skins folder, and jquery_mobile plugin (https://github.com/messagerie-melanie2/roundcube_jquery_mobile) in plugins folder

Rename the folder to "mobile" and add it to your Roundcube instance/plugins directory. Then edit Roundcube config.inc.php file and add "mobile" to the $config['plugins'] array.

For an installation with plugins manager you can follow the Roundcube Team's how-to : https://roundcubeinbox.wordpress.com/2016/04/26/roundcube-for-mobile-devices/


Attention
---------

You should only activate "mobile" plugin in config file, not the "jquery_mobile" plugin or you will have displays trouble in desktop view. jquery_mobile plugin is automatically activated by the mobile plugin when needed.
