libkolab plugin to access to Kolab groupware data
=================================================

The contained library classes establish a connection to the Kolab server
and manage the access to the Kolab groupware objects stored in various
IMAP folders. For reading and writing these objects, the PHP bindings of
the libkolabxml library are used.

This plugin also provides Elastic/Larry skin support for Kolab plugins.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* libkolabxml PHP bindings
  - kolabformat.so loaded into PHP
  - kolabformat.php placed somewhere in the include_path
* PEAR: HTTP/Request2
* PEAR: Net/URL2


INSTALLATION
------------
To use local cache you need to create a dedicated table in Roundcube's database.
To do so, execute the SQL commands in SQL/<yourdatabase>.initial.sql


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Rename config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php in the plugin folder.
For available configuration options see config.inc.php.dist file.


IMPORTANT
---------

This plugin doesn't work with the Classic skin of Roundcube because no
templates are available for that skin.

Use Roundcube `skins_allowed` option to limit skins available to the user
or remove incompatible skins from the skins folder.
