History

This plugin is based on a patch I found for roundcube 0.3 a long time ago.
Since roundcube is now able to handle the labels without modification of its source I decided to create a plugin.
There exists a "Tags plugin for RoundCube" http://sourceforge.net/projects/tagspluginrc/ which does something similar, my plugin emulates thunderbirds behaviour better I think (coloring the message rows for example)
